bear in mind that your is highly sensitive to your conscious mind, and just
about anything that falls within it's realms; the imagination, sense
perception, intuition etc, may be triggered by your conscious mind, but
it's your subconsiocus that is actually doing the imagining etc. It is
surprisingly responsive:

e.g.

orange

peace

The Sun

your subconscious reacts with subtle feelings, even if you think you're
conscious mind is rousing the imagery etc, it doesn't really matter.
Relaxing deeper and deeper is the key to getting more free flowing contact
with your image streams, but such a thing is relative. Really any
relaxation, even a minute bit will open it up. It doesn't matter if you've
just got your toe dipped in the ocean or are plummeted deep within it's
depths, at the end of the day, it's all the same ocean.

Try relaxing, when you want your image streams to be more enjoyable, to
melt blocks away, or to feel more receptive to your own innate wisdom.

From there it's really your choice, there's only guides to make it more
vivid, but the process if pretty easy, flow, build a snowball, no matter
how big, it will get bigger.

Boy, you sure think a lot!

That's good. A questioning mind is of great value. My advice to you would
be to enter the flow state before you do any image streaming of any kind,
even with a question in mind, and then just go with the flow. Things will
work themselves out.

To enter a flow state, close your eyes, sit, and repeatedly say to yourself
'relax'. When you exhale, say 'relax' and feel a warm wave of relaxation
flow down your body into your limbs and the digits of your hands and feet.
When you feel profoundly relaxed, or at least that every muscle in your
body is completely relaxed, then imagine balancing a tangerine, a flower,
or a tennis ball on the back part of your head. Pick one, and stick with
it. Balance this imaginary object on the back of your head, and keep the
image going, think about the object and its balance on the back part of
your skull. keep your back perfectly aligned.

Pretty soon you will notice a moment or two when you are no longer having
any sensation of thought (10-15 minutes or so). At this point, stop
meditating and do your image streaming. If you have an intention for your
image streaming, set your intention before meditating, then as you prepare
for recording after you are in the flow state, allow your image streaming
faculties to provide you with the images that you need to solve your
problem.

In my experience, it is neither of the options that you think it might be
judging by your email. It usually starts out as something completely
unrelated, but as you are describing it, it suddenly starts to make sense.
When it does start to make sense, let those perceptions come on line as
well, and describe them. It's like Windtunnel or sidebands of perception.

Never squelch anything, that's the opposite of what you want to do.
Squelching any thoughts in favor of what your conscious mind wants to
happen will reduce your creativity. You are not trying to control anything,
you are trying to free up all of your powers of perception, so just let it
fly free.

That's why entering flow should help you, because it will quiet your mind
to a level where you can ignore it and just experiment and let whatever
happens, happen. analyze it later. let everything flow out from within you.
You will find meaning in your creative side. At the very least you will
learn to let go and stop trying to control your creativity, which could
increase your productivity and ability to brainstorm X10.

Sincerely,
Marcus
