Man Threatens Explosion In Moscow

Thursday August 22, 2002 1:40 PM
MOSCOW (AP) - Security officers on Thursday seized an unidentified man who
said he was armed with explosives and threatened to blow up his truck in
front of Russia's Federal Security Services headquarters in Moscow, NTV
television reported.
The officers seized an automatic rifle the man was carrying, then the man
got out of the truck and was taken into custody, NTV said. No other details
were immediately available.
The man had demanded talks with high government officials, the Interfax and
ITAR-Tass news agencies said. Ekho Moskvy radio reported that he wanted to
talk with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Police and security forces rushed to the Security Service building, within
blocks of the Kremlin, Red Square and the Bolshoi Ballet, and surrounded the
man, who claimed to have one and a half tons of explosives, the news
agencies said. Negotiations continued for about one and a half hours outside
the building, ITAR-Tass and Interfax reported, citing witnesses.
The man later drove away from the building, under police escort, and drove
to a street near Moscow's Olympic Penta Hotel, where authorities held
further negotiations with him, the Moscow police press service said. The
move appeared to be an attempt by security services to get him to a more
secure location.
